            Rules:<br>
            All of these drawings come from the same category... except one!<br>
            Click on the odd one out and you'll recieve a new set of drawings.<br>
            Your score increases each for each set you successfully complete.<br>
            If you guess incorrectly, then the game ends, so guess well!<br>
            *NOTE* The exact ruleset for this mode is still undetermined until playtesting can find both a challenging and engaging experience for this game mode.
