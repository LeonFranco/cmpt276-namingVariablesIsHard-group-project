**Proposal:**
Scribbltaire.io is a single-player guessing game, where the objective is  to correctly guess the subject of each doodle drawn on the screen. Doodles are pulled, at random, from Google's [Quick Draw dataset](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data). Scribbltaire.io simulates [Skribble.io](https://skribbl.io/) which is a platform to play a drawing and guessing game but with friends or strangers. This solitaire  version, Scribbltaire.io, will provide the doodles for guessing while absolving the social requirements of Skribbl.io, while still providing expressive and social gameplay.

This app is a single player game, targeted at lonely people of all ages. A player can enjoy this quick and simple game without the need for friends or interacting with strangers.

Scribbltaire.io has one main feature being the main game mode with subproblems such as displaying the doodle, providing feedback to players’ guesses, and tracking score. There may be variations of the main feature in the form of alternate game modes such as a timed mode where a player’s score is affected by the time it takes for them to guess the drawing. The app utilizes the readily available 50 million doodles for 345 subjects from Google’s Quick Draw dataset to quickly generate doodles and enable a variety of game modes.

One possible game mode will present the player with three doodles, two of which share the same subject. The player will be asked to identify the remaining odd one by subject. Another possible mode will present a set of ten doodles of the same subject at once and time the player on how fast (and accurate) they can name the shared subject over several sets.

Some sample stories for this application include: 

 - “As a player, I want to select a game mode that suits my playstyle.” 
 - "As a player, I want to view my scores so that I can look at my progress and performance in the game.” 

The main users considered for these stories are the players themselves and actions they will perform in the game. Other actions such as using a menu to exit or restart a game are stories that fit into the epic of playing Scribbltaire.io.
